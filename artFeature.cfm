				<h2><span class="green">Feature</span> Maps</h2>
				<p>	Feature Maps are a simple visual represenation of the requirements as feature blocks 
including the navigation between them. Feature maps are an excellent way of reviewing groups of features
and the user navigation from feature to feature. It can help to quickly identify missing features or 
feature duplication.<br /><br />
				</p>
 				<p> Each feature block is cross-referenced at all times with the requirements and are named 
using verbNoun usage captured with the Requirement. Feature blocks are marked with relative complexity (Easy, Medium, 
Complex & Special Case ).<br /><br />

				<p><strong>Definitions</strong><br /> </p>

					<ul>
						<li>Easy: <i>I know eaxctly how to do this and can do it in half a day.</i></li>
						<li>Medium:<i>I know exactly how to do this, but it will be some work.</i> </li>
						<li>Complex:<i>Somehow we will implement this feature.</i> </li>
						<li>Special Case: <i>I am not sure we can do this.</i></li>
