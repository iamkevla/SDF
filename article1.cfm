			<h2>What is <span class="green">this?</span></h2>
			<p>	The aim of the <strong>Software Definition Framework</strong> is to provide a simple tool
to assist in the definition of basic functional websites for Businesses. The key objectives of this project
is to give the business the ability to quickly capture and manage system requirements using a single tool.
Including, the ability to validate system requirements using feature maps and Wireframes (features to come later).
 At all times all the objects, controls and services  can be quickly referenced back to the original requirements. 
 Finally it should be intuitive and amazingly simple and fun to use.<br /><br />
			</p>
			<p> It is somewhat based on Agile development methodology where the customer is involved in 
creating "user stories" (Requirements) and prioritising them to before they are worked on by developers. 
A "user story" is a simple statement about what a user wants to do with a feature of the software. This 
method of capturing requirements throughout a project is an alternative to writing lengthy requirements 
specifications all up-front. <br /><br />
			</p>
			<p> The Requirements should focus on who, what and why of a given feature, not how.<br/>
			</p>
			<p> The Guidelines for Requirements Gathering are;<br />
			</p>
			<p> 
				<ul>
<li>1. The Customer is responsible for formulating the requirements. Each individual requirement represents a single feature of the solution.</li>
<li>2. Each requirement shall be made as one or two sentences in everyday language of the customer.</li>
<li>3. The requirement group will be used to group requirements into logical areas.</li>
<li>4. if the developer and customer find that the description is lacking is some way (too large, complicated, imprecise) it is rewritten until satisfactory.</li>
<li>5. Requirements must be prioritised by the customer.</li>
<li>6. The developer is responsible for breaking down the requirements into tasks and providing estimates.</li>
<li>7. Sign-off by both the customer and the developer signifies Requirements Gathering milestone complete.</li>
				</ul><br/>
