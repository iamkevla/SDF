# SDF Angularized #

Tool for managing Software Requirements redone using [AngularJS]

Built using my favourite webstack now (Coldfusion, AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, jqueryUI, AngularUI Bootstrap and flot). 

Makes use of flot graphs, jqueryUI sortable, star-rating widget and typeahead as directives.
